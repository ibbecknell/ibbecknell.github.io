<h3><br>But First, What are Mushrooms?</br></h3>
		<p>All mushrooms are fungi, but not all fungi are mushrooms.&nbsp; For those fungi that produce them, the mushroom plays a similar role to a flower or a fruit in plants.&nbsp; Some part of each mature mushroom produces microscopic spores that are similar to pollen or seeds, sometimes numbering in the trillions.&nbsp; The rest of the fungal organism typically lives in the soil, wood, or some other material and is composed of thread-like strands known as mycelium.&nbsp; The expanding growth of the mycelium often results in circles of mushrooms or &ldquo;fairy rings.&rdquo;&nbsp; An individual mycelium can grow quite large, with at least one well-documented case covering more than 1,500 acres in Oregon.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Many mushroom-producing species are important decomposers, particularly of wood.&nbsp; These species are often relatively easy to cultivate.&nbsp; However, many species have a special, symbiotic, &ldquo;mycorrhizal&rdquo; relationship with particular species of plants. Often, neither the mushroom nor the plant will grow without a mycorrhizal partner.</p>
		<p>Most mushroom-producing fungi are members of the phylums Basidiomycota or Ascomycota.&nbsp; The technical difference between these groups has to do with how the spores develop, which can be detected only by using a microscope.&nbsp; However, the &ldquo;ascos&rdquo; (ascospores) are less frequently noticed and are often shaped like small cups.&nbsp; Probably the best-known ascos are the highly prized morels (genus <em>Morchella</em>), which typically fruit in the spring and are often mycorrhizal, or the true truffles (genus <em>Tuber</em>), all of which are mycorrhizal.</p>

	<p><br>Most of the well-known mushrooms are &ldquo;basidios,&rdquo; including widely cultivated species like the button mushroom (pictured below)</br></p>
