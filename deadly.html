<h1>The World's Most Poisonous Mushrooms</h1>
</span>
<p><span class="bold"><strong>Learning about poisonous mushrooms is crucial if you want to start eating specimens you find in the woods.</strong></span> Eating the wrong wild mushroom can result in dizziness, diarrhea, and even death.</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/image-files/beware-poisonous-mushrooms.jpg" alt="poisonous mushrooms" width="276" height="183" align="right" class="x-rightfloat"/>But don't be afraid, mushroom hunting can be an awesome experience. Identifying and eating wild mushrooms simply requires a combination of education and caution.</p>
        <p><b>Always make a positive identification and only eat young, fresh specimens.</b> <br>To be safe, if you are eating a new mushroom for the first time, try a very small amount first, then wait for at least 24 hours for any negative effects.</p>
        
        <p>We'll take a look at some of the famous and common toxic mushrooms such as <em>Amanitas</em>, little brown mushrooms, and false morels. These are responsible for almost all the deadly poisonings in the United States. They have edible cousins that look almost exactly alike, despite some key features, so it's crucial to learn their characteristics and avoid them. </p>
        <h2>Famous Poisonous Mushrooms</h2>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <h3>The <em>Amanita </em></h3>
        <p><img src="http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/image-files/identify-amanita-mushrooms.jpg" alt="Learn to identify one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the amanita genus" width="185" height="247" align="right" class="x-rightfloat"/>The <span class="italic"><em>Amanita</em></span> mushroom genus contains some of the deadliest mushrooms in the world. Certain species contain a lethal toxin called amanitin, that kills by shutting down the liver and kidneys. </p>
        
        <p>Not every <em>Amanita</em> is dangerous but some will kill. Of those, the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide are attributed to the  &quot;death cap&quot;, or <span class="italic"><em>Amanita phalloides</em>.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>LBMs (Little Brown Mushrooms) Are Everywhere </h3>
        <p><img src="http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/image-files/little-brown-mushrooms.jpg" alt="Little Brown Mushrooms contain many species of poisonous mushrooms" width="147" height="197" align="right" class="x-rightfloat"/>Nicknamed LBMs (little brown mushrooms), these little brown mushrooms on the ground look similar and are hard to identify. </p>
        
        <p>While many LBMs are harmless others will make you sick. Some contain the same amatoxins as certain amanitas, so it's best to avoid all little brown mushrooms. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>False Morels (<span class="italic"><em>Gyromitra</em></span> and <span class="italic"><em>Verpa</em></span> species)</h3>
        <p><img src="http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/image-files/false-morel.jpg" alt="False Morel Mushroom - One of the poisonous mushrooms" width="178" height="238" align="right" class="x-rightfloat"/> &quot;false morel&quot; includes several different species that are often mistaken for the edible members of the <span class="italic"><em>Morchella</em></span> genus, which are called &quot;true morels&quot;. </p>
        <p>Many false morels can cause vomiting, dizziness, and sometimes death. Although this is the case, in some parts of the world, people boil and eat false morels with no negative effect. </p>
        <p>Avoid false morels altogether.  No one knows how toxic any particular false morel will be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>The Jack o'Lantern (<span class="italic"><em>Omphalotus olearius</em></span>) </h3>
        <p>The jack o'lantern, or <span class="italic"><em>Omphalotus olearius</em></span>, is a famous mushroom that looks similar to certain types of chanterelles. </p>
        <p><img src="http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/image-files/jack-o-lantern-mushroom.jpg" alt="jack o'lantern mushroom" width="219" height="164" align="right" class="x-rightfloat"/>The jack o'lantern contains a toxin called muscarine, which causes diarrhea and sever cramps. They're not deadly, but can result in an extremely unpleasant experience where hospitalization is sometimes necessary.</p>
