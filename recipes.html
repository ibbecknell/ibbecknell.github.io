<h1>Delicious Mushroom Recipes</h1>

<p><strong>Cooking Mushrooms</strong></p>
	<p>Cooking mushrooms to the proper temperature is important when trying to maximize flavor. Use a hot, well-oiled pan and cook until golden. More flavor will be extracted from the mushrooms if they're browned before being added to a broth or sauce. Season them to taste with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs. A sprinkling of fresh lemon juice will brighten the mushroom flavor, as well.</p>

<h3> 3 Wild Mushroom Recipes</h3>
	
	<p><strong>--Recipe#1: Mushroom a la Grecque (Pickled Mushrooms)</strong></p>
		<p>These tasty mushrooms are nice on their own as a canape or tossed into a salad as a condiment.</p>
		<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong></p>
			<p>2 pounds white button mushrooms, cut into quarters<br />1 cup white wine<br />1 cup champagne or apple cider vinegar<br />Â½ cup olive oil<br />3 cups water<br />4 cloves garlic<br />4 bay leaves<br />2 teaspoons salt<br />20 black peppercorns<br />15 coriander seeds<br />6 branches parsley<br />2 sprigs oregano<br />2 sprigs thyme</p>
		<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
			<p>Set mushrooms aside in a glass jar or bowl. Place remaining ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow to steep for 20 minutes. Strain over mushrooms and top with water to cover. Let cool to room temperature before refrigerating.</p>
		
	<p><strong>--Recipe#2: Mushroom Ketchup</strong></p>
		<p>This full-flavored condiment is a perfect steak sauce, reminiscent of Worcestershire sauce.</p>
		<p>Yields 1 quart</p>
		<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
			<p>2 pounds portobello mushrooms, diced into 1/2-inch pieces<br />1 4-inch knob ginger root, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces<br />2 shallots, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces<br />3 Tablespoons salt<br />1-1/4 cups red wine vinegar<br />1 teaspoon peppercorns<br />1 teaspoon ground allspice<br />1/8 teaspoon each ground ginger and nutmeg<br />1 quart chicken or vegetable broth</p>
		<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
			<p>Layer mushrooms, ginger, and shallots with salt and let marinate for two days. Put the mushrooms with their released liquid and the vinegar and spices into a 3-quart saucepan and cook until dry. Add broth and cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, until flavor intensifies. Puree in a food processor until smooth. Let cool and store in covered jars.</p>
		
	<p><strong>--Recipe#3: Toasted Angel Hair Pasta in Wild Mushroom Broth</strong></p>
		<p>Toasting the angel hair maintains the structure of the pasta and allows it to absorb the flavorful broth without getting sticky. Porcini powder gives the broth an added mushroom flavor, but the dish is also delicious without it.</p>
		<p>Serves 4 to 6</p>
		
		<p><strong>Pasta Ingredients:</strong></p>
			<p>1 pound dried angel hair pasta<br />2 Tablespoons olive oil<br />3 cups mushroom stock (see recipe below)</p>
			<p>To toast pasta, set oven at 350 degrees F. Rub olive oil throughout dried raw pasta until absorbed. Spread evenly on sheet pan and bake until golden brown in oven, about 10 minutes. Drop into boiling water and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes. Strain and cool under running water. Set aside.</p>
		<p><strong>Mushroom Stock Ingredients:</strong></p>
			<p> 1/4 cup olive oil<br />1 medium peeled onion, diced into 1/4-inch pieces<br />1/2 pound mixed wild mushrooms, such as oyster, shiitake, or black trumpet<br />1 quart water or chicken broth<br />1 Tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br /> 1/4 cup porcini powder (optional)</p>
			<p>2 cups cleaned, chopped spinach<br />Salt and pepper to taste</p>
		<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
			<p>Heat olive oil in a large saute pan. Add onion and cook on low heat until caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to caramelize and cover with water or stock and allow to cook, approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
			<p>Whisk in porcini powder. Drop in spinach and cook an additional 3 minutes until wilted. Add cooked pasta and serve.</p>
